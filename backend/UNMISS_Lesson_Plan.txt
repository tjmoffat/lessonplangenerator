SECTION 2: LESSON PROCEDURE
Stage: Lead In
Time: 8 mins
Description:
Students work in small groups to discuss and list examples of what the Vietnamese Army does during peacekeeping missions. Groups present one example each. Teacher then introduces UNMISS as a key peacekeeping context in Africa and shows a map of South Sudan.
Purpose:
To activate schema, set the thematic context of human security, and create relevance to students’ own roles as peacekeepers.
Teacher’s Notes:
Use a map visual and flag of South Sudan to activate geographical awareness.
ICQs: “Are you writing or speaking in your group?” “One or two ideas?”
Pair students with mixed proficiency to ensure peer support and modelling of responses.
Stage: Pre-Teach Vocabulary
Time: 10 mins
Description:
1. Mandate – 'The UN has a mandate to protect civilians.'
2. Civilians – 'UN soldiers help keep civilians safe in conflict areas.'
3. Conflict – 'There has been a long conflict in South Sudan.'
4. Patrol – 'Soldiers go on patrol to check the safety of an area.'
5. Human security – 'Human security includes safety, food, and rights for all people.'
6. Peacekeeper – 'Peacekeepers do not fight but work to stop violence.'
Purpose:
To ensure students can access and understand core vocabulary in the reading text.
Teacher’s Notes:
Provide visuals to support comprehension.
Teach each Vocabulary item using Meaning → Form → Pronunciation, in that order.
Refer to the separately provided Language Analysis document for detailed guidance on how to present and check each word effectively.
Stage: Gist Reading
Time: 10 mins
Description:
Students read the adapted UNMISS article individually and answer one gist question: “What is the main purpose of the UN in South Sudan?” They select from 3 short options. They check answers in pairs before class feedback.
Purpose:
To encourage skimming for general understanding and reinforce the main idea.
Teacher’s Notes:
Pre-highlight title and subheading for learners to help them predict content.
Use CCQs: “Are we looking for small details?” (No). “Just the big idea?” (Yes).
Support lower-level readers by previewing questions before the reading begins.
Stage: Detailed Reading
Time: 12 mins
Description:
Students reread the article and complete a matching task: six factual statements must be matched with parts of the text. Example: “UN soldiers help with medical care” → students find the correct paragraph.
Purpose:
To build scanning skills and deepen understanding of specific peacekeeping activities.
Teacher’s Notes:
Use ICQs to clarify task: “Are we matching or writing full sentences?” (Matching).
Scaffold by guiding learners to locate paragraph numbers first.
Offer bilingual glossary support if needed for weaker readers.
Stage: Post-Reading Task
Time: 12 mins
Description:
In pairs, students use new vocabulary to write 3 sentences about what UNMISS peacekeepers do in South Sudan. Then, they write one short paragraph (3–5 lines) summarising peacekeepers’ roles. Volunteers read their summaries aloud.
Purpose:
To reinforce vocabulary, synthesise information, and provide an authentic written output.
Teacher’s Notes:
Use a sentence frame for support: “UN peacekeepers help to ___ because ___.”
AfL: Check sentences as students write and provide immediate correction.
Differentiate by giving stronger learners open-ended writing while supporting others with structure.
Stage: Reflection
Time: 8 mins
Description:
Students complete a short reflection form (“exit ticket”) answering: 1) What did I learn today? 2) Which word was new for me? 3) How can I use this information in my future peacekeeping role?
Purpose:
To encourage metacognitive thinking and assess students’ personal takeaways and confidence with the material.
Teacher’s Notes:
Use colour-coded slips (green/yellow/red) to assess understanding.
Encourage students to write in either English or Vietnamese if ideas are unclear.
Use responses to inform future vocabulary revision and extension tasks.
SECTION 3: ANTICIPATED CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS
Type: Vocabulary
Challenge: Students may confuse abstract terms like “human security” and “mandate,” interpreting them as military-only concepts.
Solution: Provide contextualised definitions and visual examples that contrast military security and human security. Reinforce with CCQs and simple paraphrasing.

Type: Reading Strategy
Challenge: Some students may try to read every word for meaning during the gist stage, which can slow them down and lead to misunderstanding.
Solution: Model reading quickly for the main idea, using headlines and the first sentence of each paragraph. Highlight keywords before reading.

Type: Written Production
Challenge: Learners may feel unconfident writing full sentences or summaries using new vocabulary.
Solution: Use scaffolding sentence frames and sentence starters. Provide peer models and allow use of dictionaries or bilingual support for key terms.

SECTION 4: TEACHER’S TOOLKIT
Assessment for Learning Strategies:

- Students use coloured cards to show confidence levels after each task—green (clear), yellow (unsure), red (confused).
- Teacher monitors pair work during reading tasks and notes common language errors or misunderstandings for group feedback.
- Exit ticket reflections are collected and analysed to inform next lesson planning and target areas for review.

Innovative Ways to Modify the Lesson:

- Introduce short audio clips of UN officers speaking about their work to build listening skills and bring authentic voices into the lesson.
- Use real UN images and have students match captions with them to support visual literacy alongside reading.
- Convert the vocabulary task into a “mission briefing” role-play, where students explain peacekeeper duties to a ‘new recruit’.

Optional Extension Task:

- Students write a short (100-word) reflection journal entry about how the UNMISS mission is similar or different to their own peacekeeping duties.
- Create a short group presentation (2–3 mins) on “3 ways peacekeepers protect civilians,” using text and new vocabulary.
- Research task: Learners read a second article at home and prepare one question to ask their peers about human security.

Teacher Reflection Questions:

- Were students able to explain the idea of human security clearly in their own words?
- Did the vocabulary support provide enough scaffolding for learners at different levels?
- How did the cultural relevance of the topic affect student engagement and motivation?
