Create: student-facing handouts for the lesson that was described in the lesson plan you have just generated.  Do not include any teacher-facing notes, metadata, or reflections.

Context: These are going to be pulled through directly into a student facing handout. So only create tasks that have formatting that can be accommodated in a word document. For example, a mix and match task will be very tricky to consistently format correctly in the template document. Below are some examples of where this is done effectively:

Example 1: 

Task 1: True or False

Instructions: Read the passage. Decide if each statement is true (T) or false (F).

1.	Peacekeepers always use weapons in every mission.
2.	The local population often helps peacekeepers build trust.
3.	Peacekeepers must never speak to civilians.
4.	Training helps peacekeepers handle dangerous situations.
5.	A peacekeeping mission can include rebuilding schools and roads.


üüß INPUT 1: LESSON PLAN SECTIONS 1 & 2  
{{lessonPlanSection1and2}}

üüß INPUT 2: READING OR LISTENING OR GRAMMAR PASSAGE  
{{readingPassage}}

üü¶ TASK:
Create a single printable student handout that matches all of the tasks in the Lesson Procedure (Section 2), using the reading passage as the core input. 

üü© FORMATTING:
‚Ä¢ Output must be Word-exportable  
‚Ä¢ Use bold for task headings (e.g., ‚ÄúTask 1: Vocabulary‚Äù)  
‚Ä¢ Use bullet points, tables, lines or spacing as appropriate  
‚Ä¢ Do NOT include teacher notes, rationale, or explanations  

‚ú® *Formatting instructions for AI output:*

- Use markdown syntax for **all lists**, including materials, vocabulary, checklists, slide headings, etc.
- Bulleted lists must use `- item` (dash + space + text)
- Ordered lists must use `1. item`, `2. item`, etc.
- Each list item must be on its own line.
- Use `##` for section and subsection headings.
- Do NOT use plain text lists or manual indentation.
- Ensure no Markdown artifacts like `*` or `_` appear in the output text (except for valid Markdown).

When producing output, do NOT include raw Markdown syntax such as `*` or `_` characters in the visible text. Instead, format lists and headings properly so they appear as formatted text in a Word document or HTML preview.
