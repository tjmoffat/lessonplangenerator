Create: Use the lesson plan provided to complete 2 separate documents for a lesson:

Document 1. Meaning, Form, Pronunciation document
Document 2. Reading Passage Document

Considerations ordered by importance: 

-SUPER engaging and meaningful content
- connect to authentic real-world scenarios
-language proficiency level
-tailored to cultural and linguistic background
-student-centred, age suitable
-comprehensible input theory
-scaffolding & diff.

Use the lesson plan provided to complete the following two tasks:
However, IF there is not a ‚Äòpre-teach vocabulary‚Äô section in the lesson plan, do not create a MFP document.

{{lessonPlanSection1and2}}

üüß INPUT 2: VOCABULARY LIST FROM PRE-TEACH VOCABULARY  
{{vocabularyList}}
PART 1 ‚Äì MFP Document
Use the vocabulary list provided in the lesson plan's Pre-Teach Vocabulary stage:
{Insert full vocabulary list from LP Section 2 here, e.g. device, charger, power cut, etc.}

Meaning:
Form:
Pronunciation:
Anticipated Problems:
Solutions:

Follow these instructions:
‚Ä¢	Meaning: Short, learner-accessible definition. Use contrast or real-world context if helpful.
‚Ä¢	Form: Part of speech. Include natural collocations or patterns. One model sentence per word.
‚Ä¢	Pronunciation: NO IPA. Use syllable + stress format (e.g., ‚ÄúTwo syllables: CHARG-er. Stress on the first.‚Äù). Mention any sounds likely to confuse students from this age/L1 group.
‚Ä¢	Anticipated Problems: 1‚Äì2 issues learners may have with understanding, form, or pronunciation ‚Äî based on their A2 level and L1 (if known).
‚Ä¢	Solutions: 1 solution per problem using classroom-ready strategies. Use one of the below solutions for each one:
‚Ä¢	CCQs
‚Ä¢	Realia or visuals
‚Ä¢	Strong contextualised example
‚Ä¢	Clines
‚Ä¢	Board highlight
‚Ä¢	Gap-fill or sentence frame
‚Ä¢	Eliciting forms
‚Ä¢	Guided substitution
‚Ä¢	Timelines
‚Ä¢	Choral + individual drilling
‚Ä¢	Minimal pairs
‚Ä¢	Hand claps / gesture for stress
‚Ä¢	Backchaining
‚Ä¢	Recording + playback

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not use IPA or overly technical grammar language. Keep the layout clean.  
Example 1 ‚Äì A2, Chinese first language learners:
Example MFP Entry:

## Word or phrase:  
cheap

Meaning:  
Describes something that does not cost much money. Opposite of "expensive."

Form:  
Adjective; often used after ‚Äúis‚Äù or before a noun.  
Model sentence: That jacket is very cheap.

Pronunciation:  
One syllable: CHEAP.  
Stress on the word. Chinese learners may pronounce 'ch' as /ts/ or /s/.

Anticipated Problems:  
Learners may confuse ‚Äúcheap‚Äù with ‚Äúpoor quality.‚Äù  
Learners may struggle with the ‚Äúch‚Äù sound (e.g., using /s/ or /ts/ instead).

Solutions:  
CCQ: Is it good or bad if something is cheap? (Answer: Good)  
Use a cline: cheap ‚Üí okay price ‚Üí expensive.  
Minimal pair drill: cheap vs. sheep, chip vs. ship.


Example 2 ‚Äì B2, Spanish First Language learners:
## Word or phrase:
apply for
Meaning:
To formally ask for a job or place on a course.
Form:
Phrasal verb (inseparable); apply + for + noun.
Model sentence: I applied for the job last week.
Pronunciation:
Two syllables: ap-PLY.
Stress on the second syllable.
Spanish learners may translate directly and use ‚Äúsolicit‚Äù.
Anticipated Problems:
Learners may omit ‚Äúfor‚Äù or confuse it with ‚Äúask for‚Äù.
Direct translation from Spanish may result in incorrect usage like ‚Äúsolicit‚Äù.
Solutions:
Board contrast: apply for a job ‚â† ask for help
Sentence frame: I want to apply for ___.
END OF PART 1

START OF PART 2
PART 2 ‚Äì Reading or Listening Passage or Passages (depending on lesson plan)
Include title that is relevant to the topic (do not have wording like ‚ÄòReading Passage‚Äô or ‚ÄòListening Passage‚Äô)
Write any reading or listening passages required for this lesson. Length = 
Minimum Length per level:
- A1: 150 words.
- A2: 240 words.
- B1: 350 words.
- B2: 450 words.
- C1: 600 words.

Constraint: Do not produce a response under these word counts (depending on CEFR level). 
Use the Lesson Plan‚Äôs Overview and Procedure sections (1 and 2) to guide content, topic, tone, grammatical complexity and vocabulary:
‚Ä¢	Topic: {Insert LP topic here}
‚Ä¢	CEFR Level: {Insert level, e.g. A2}
‚Ä¢	Lesson aim: {Insert main objective}
‚Ä¢	Target vocabulary: {List of words}
‚Ä¢	Skills focus: {Insert e.g. reading for gist and detail}
‚Ä¢	Student age group: {e.g. 13‚Äì16 years old}

The passage should:

‚Ä¢	Reflect the topic of the lesson and be SUPER engaging to this age group
‚Ä¢	Be as directly relevant as possible to the learner
‚Ä¢	Include ALL the vocabulary items as possible in natural, contextual use
‚Ä¢	Mirror the lesson‚Äôs learning objectives
‚Ä¢	Use grammar and language that is appropriate for the learners (comprehensible input)
‚Ä¢	Avoid cultural bias or references that learners may not understand
‚Ä¢   Begin the passage with a title formatted as a level 2 heading (Heading 2) ‚Äì use markdown: ## Title  
‚Ä¢   Separate each paragraph with TWO newlines (press Enter twice). This creates a blank line between paragraphs.
‚Ä¢   Example:
    Paragraph one text goes here.

    Paragraph two text starts here.
    
Do not write comprehension questions. Do not label or explain the text. This will be inserted into a handout later.

Hard Condition: If the word count for the passage ‚Äì based on the language level of learners - is not met, regenerate the passage until it is.
