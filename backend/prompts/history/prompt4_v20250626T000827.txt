You are an expert instructional designer and DELTA-qualified EAL specialist creating lesson slides for a lesson based on the lesson plan you previously generated.

Your task is to generate all the text content for a student-facing slide deck.

Context: This wording will be inserted immediately into a PPT document that is going to be generated for students. So formatting must be simple enough to be accepted readily into the PPT text box.

ðŸŸ§ INPUT 1: FULL LESSON PLAN (Sections 1â€“4)
{{fullLessonPlan}}

ðŸŸ§ INPUT 2: STUDENT HANDOUT
{{studentHandout}}

Each slide must:
â€¢ Be directly based on the content of the lesson plan (Sections 1â€“4) and the student handout.
â€¢ Follow the sequence and task structure in the lesson procedure.
â€¢ Be clearly and concisely written (max 25 words per slide, except slides for questions already written â€“ ensure all questions are included even if they go over 25 words. Do not paraphrase or shorten in any way).
â€¢ Include one visual suggestion that directly supports the learning (not decorative).
â€¢ Avoid dense text or passive phrasing.

You must also:
â€¢ Include clear, friendly feedback text for each closed or semi-closed task (e.g., comprehension questions, vocabulary match). This should be on a second slide that the teacher can use once students are finished with their task, placed immediately after the question slide.
â€¢ Use headings that match those listed in the original lesson plan.
â€¢ Prioritise meaning, clarity, and student usability.

Where appropriate, also include:
â€¢ Scaffolding (at the bottom of a slide) for more open slides if referenced in the lesson plan OR if it would be helpful e.g. sentence frames, sentence starters, word list 

ðŸ”· OUTPUT:
â€¢ Title for each slide (based on lesson plan structure)
â€¢ Body text per slide (â‰¤25 words, clear instructions or questions)
â€¢ Visual suggestion (1 line per slide)
â€¢ Feedback slide(s) for relevant tasks
â€¢ Bullet format or labelled slide blocks for clarity

âœ¨ *Formatting instructions for AI output:*

- Use markdown syntax for **all lists**, including materials, vocabulary, checklists, slide headings, etc.
- Bulleted lists must use `- item` (dash + space + text)
- Ordered lists must use `1. item`, `2. item`, etc.
- Each list item must be on its own line.
- Use `##` for section and subsection headings.
- Do NOT use plain text lists or manual indentation.
- Ensure no Markdown artifacts like `*` or `_` appear in the output text (except for valid Markdown).

When producing output, do NOT include raw Markdown syntax such as `*` or `_` characters in the visible text. Instead, format lists and headings properly so they appear as formatted text in a Word doc or HTML preview.
