One Page Vision

Goal: Build an online business that generates exceptional, ready to use lesson plans on demand that are tailored to teacher specifications.

Method:

1.	Set up a website for the business
2.	Create a lesson plan page that has a drop-down menu with fields such as; language level, age, topic, lesson type etc.
3.	Allow teachers to select the correct lesson type
4.	Create a prompt that is sent to GPT via an API key. This prompt is proprietary and incorporates the specifications set out by the teacher. I will have 25 different prompts, and the choices selected by the teacher will determine which prompt is sent
5.	This generates text, in a specific format, for the following documents; lesson plan, language analysis, slide handouts, PPT slides, student + teacher worksheet. I may have to prioritise certain docs based on token size and amount
6.	The text is generated by Chat GPT and then, in the back end, I have a library of documents that the text is used to fill, in specific places. These documents will be branded and highly professional
7.	There will be a selection of images that are held within the website backend and tagged. These are used in the PPT slides as necessary e.g. if the teacher wants to teach the word ‘car’ the website can automatically insert the picture tagged car alongside the relevant text
